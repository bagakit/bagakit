# Feature Tracker Contract

This document defines the stable runtime and planning contract for
`bagakit-feature-tracker`.

## Scope

This contract covers:

- tracker runtime surfaces
- closeout storage surfaces
- local-only issuer boundary
- source-of-truth rules
- dependency projection semantics

This contract does not define the public feature-id shape.

That belongs to:

- `docs/specs/feature-tracker-id-issuance.md`

## Runtime Surfaces

Stable tracker-owned runtime files live under:

- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/index/features.json`
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/runtime-policy.json`
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/features/<feature-id>/state.json`
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/features/<feature-id>/tasks.json`
- optional `.bagakit/feature-tracker/features/<feature-id>/goal.md`
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/features/<feature-id>/owner-receipt.json` for
  reviewed execution or Goal continuation
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/features-archived/<feature-id>/`
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/features-discarded/<feature-id>/`
- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/local/issuer.json`

Tracked planning truth lives under:

- `features/`
- `index/features.json`
- `runtime-policy.json`

Closed planning truth lives under:

- `features-archived/`
- `features-discarded/`
- `features-transferred/`

## Local-Only Issuer Boundary

The tracker may use local-only issuer state to mint new feature ids.

That local issuer state is not canonical planning truth.

Required boundary:

- local issuer state must remain outside tracked tracker truth
- local guard material must remain git-local
- active and closed feature records must stay valid when local issuer state is
  absent on another machine

Stable local issuer surfaces are:

- `.bagakit/feature-tracker/local/issuer.json`
- one git-local config key owned by the tracker implementation

## Source-Of-Truth Rule

- `features.json` owns the ordered feature index and tracked issuance cursor.
- `state.json` owns one feature's lifecycle and workspace truth.
- `tasks.json` owns one feature's task truth.
- `goal.md`, when present, owns one feature's stable long-running Agent control
  contract: final outcome, invariants, final acceptance, authority, durable
  orchestration principles, and bounded context references.
- `runtime-policy.json` owns tracker policy defaults, Feature-level
  verification policy, project classification, and doctor thresholds; it does
  not own Task completion commands.
- `show-feature-dag` computes a read-only dependency projection on demand from
  canonical feature state; no projection file owns additional truth.
- archive and discard directories own closed feature records after closeout.
- a `transferred` Feature is a closed record whose unfinished current-plan
  Tasks moved to a reviewed successor; `state.json.transferred_to` points to
  that successor and the successor carries `state.json.transferred_from`.

Implications:

- `tasks.json` is the only task source of truth
- the default feature directory contains `state.json`, `tasks.json`, and
  optional canonical `goal.md`; reviewed execution or Goal continuation also
  derives `owner-receipt.json`
- `state.json.goal_contract` binds the exact Goal schema, repo-relative path,
  and SHA-256 revision; `state.json.goal` remains only a concise index summary
- Feature Tracker validates Goal identity, binding, content presence, and
  portability; authoring headings, prose order, and semantic quality remain
  `bagakit-set-loop-goal` concerns
- Goal must not own a second lifecycle, task plan, dependency graph, blocker,
  event stream, completion evidence, review state, or archive
- `state.json` may also carry runtime-owner semantics such as `runtime_role`
  and `runtime_relations`; when present, `index/features.json` should project
  them as read-optimized index state rather than inventing them independently
- Task blocker class and prose remain in `tasks.json.last_blocker`; neither is
  copied into the index
- root-level helper markdown files such as `proposal.md`, `spec-delta.md`, and
  `verification.md` are optional operator aids, not authoritative task state
- local issuer state may help create new ids but may not redefine tracked
  feature truth
- external bridges may read tracker truth but do not become tracker truth

## Feature Family And Task Boundary

Feature is the stable goal boundary. Task is the extension mechanism inside
that boundary.

Rules:

- normalized `state.json.slug` is the deterministic family key among active
  Features
- at most one non-closed Feature may own a family key
- `create-feature` without reviewed tasks is idempotent for an existing family
  and must return the existing Feature without mutating state or allocating an
  id
- reviewed work aimed at an existing family must use `set-task-plan` with the
  current revision; create must not silently merge, renumber, or discard Task
  semantics
- create a different Feature only when the goal, protected invariants, or
  acceptance boundary is materially different
- archived and discarded Features are immutable history and do not reserve the
  family key for a future lifecycle
- family matching is exact after slug normalization; the deterministic tracker
  must not perform fuzzy or embedding-based semantic merges

Planning-entry handoffs that resolve to an existing active family must stop and
route their extension through that Feature's Task plan.


## Runtime Ownership Split Contract

### Failure, blocking, and replanning

`blocked` means the Agent has no executable recovery within the currently
authorized scope and available resources. It is relative to that boundary,
not a claim that the goal is permanently impossible. The reason must identify
the unavailable condition. New blocker records should also carry optional
`last_blocker.owner` and `last_blocker.resume_when` strings identifying who or
what can change it and what evidence permits resumption; the projection marks
missing values as `unspecified` so ambiguity is visible instead of hidden. A normal code defect, failed gate, difficult optimization, or
untried approach is not sufficient to stop as blocked.

When evidence disproves the Task's assumed solution or acceptance path, mark
the old node `failed` and rethink the plan. `finish-task --result failed`
requires `--failure-assumption` and `--failure-reason` (the observation that
disproved it). It accepts a current `in_progress` or `blocked` Task, replacing
any current blocker with `failure = {assumption, reason}` in `tasks.json`.
The failed node is terminal, cannot restart, and never satisfies dependents.
A failing gate alone leaves the Task active so ordinary repair can continue.

The execution owner must inspect affected descendants, preserve the user's
goal, distinguish user constraints from Agent assumptions, and install a
reviewed successor through `set-task-plan --expected-revision`. Existing user
authorization or delegated planning authority remains sufficient; changing a
user constraint requires a specific user decision. Merely saying "replanning"
in chat or a progress receipt does not install a plan.

The next reviewed revision must remove each current failed node and declare
its replacement through the existing `supersedes` relation. The old node and
its failure evidence remain immutable with derived `superseded_by` links;
there is no second successor field and no requirement to invent future Task
ids before rethinking. The new plan records its revision and review ref.
Independent active/runnable work may continue; when that frontier is exhausted,
failed Tasks require Feature status `replanning` and owner continuation
`blocked` with `replan_required`, even if a separate real blocker also exists.
This owner-level handoff asks for planning work, not passive waiting.

Read-only queries expose pending failed nodes and installed successor revisions
from canonical Task lineage. Installed, started, and done successors remain
distinct observations. Tracker does not launch an Agent or guarantee recovery.

Some features are runtime frontdoors only.
Others own the currently executing lane.

The tracker may represent that distinction in canonical feature state.

Stable runtime-owner fields:

- `state.json.runtime_role`
  - `standalone`
  - `frontdoor_context`
  - `execution_owner`
  - `foreground_owner`
- `state.json.runtime_relations`
  - list of typed feature-to-feature runtime links
  - stable relation values:
    - `frontdoor_for`
    - `handoff_from`

Projection rule:

- `state.json` remains canonical for runtime role and relation fields
- each blocked Task owns its exact blocker in `tasks.json.last_blocker`; a
  cancelled Task owns a non-blocking explanation in `tasks.json.cancel_reason`
- `index/features.json` does not copy blocker truth
- the execution-owner receipt derives Task blockers from blocked Tasks and a
  planning blocker from cancelled Tasks when the whole Feature frontier needs
  replanning
- dependency projection output must not carry them because they are not
  dependency truth

Required invariants:

- `status = blocked` means unfinished current-plan Tasks exist while no Task is
  active or runnable and at least one current Task has a real blocker
- `status = replanning` means no Task is active or runnable, no real blocker is
  attributable, and one or more current Tasks were cancelled pending a
  reviewed successor plan
- every blocked Task carries one canonical `last_blocker`; cancelled Tasks
  carry `cancel_reason` instead and neither status becomes a mirror of the
  other
- a `parked_context` Task blocker requires `runtime_role = frontdoor_context`
- `frontdoor_context` features may only point outward with
  `runtime_relations[].relation = frontdoor_for`
- `execution_owner` features may only point outward with
  `runtime_relations[].relation = handoff_from`
- `foreground_owner` features may only point outward with
  `runtime_relations[].relation = handoff_from`
- cross-feature runtime links should stay symmetric:
  `frontdoor_for(A -> B)` requires `handoff_from(B -> A)`

These fields describe runtime ownership posture only.

`finish-task --result blocked` requires both `--blocked-reason-class` and
`--blocked-reason` and writes the exact pair to that Task's terminal
`last_blocker`. `finish-task --result cancelled` requires
`--cancel-reason`, writes no blocker, and moves the Feature into
`replanning` when no independent work remains. Reblocking a restarted Task
replaces its `last_blocker` with the new terminal result. Historical Task
records retain `last_blocker` or `cancel_reason`.
History prose is audit context only and must not be parsed as blocker authority.

`--result done` rejects blocker and cancellation arguments. A blocked Task does
not block independent runnable work. A cancelled Task does not satisfy its
dependents and therefore cannot make downstream work runnable. The Feature
becomes blocked only when no current Task is active or runnable and a real Task
blocker exists; it becomes `replanning` when the stalled frontier is caused
only by cancelled Tasks. Archiving or discarding keeps historical Task blocker
and cancellation evidence while the closed owner receipt has no current
blockers.

Owner receipts must project exact canonical Task blockers and must not invent a
default class or reason. A blocked Feature without attributable Task-level
blocker evidence is invalid.
Canonical blocker class and reason strings must not carry surrounding
whitespace.
They do not replace dependency truth, task truth, or closeout state.

## Planning Entry Handoff Consumption Rule

The tracker may materialize canonical planning truth from one approved
planning-entry handoff.

That handoff is an exchange surface, not new tracker truth by itself.

Allowed direction:

- approved planning-entry handoff -> tracker `state.json` and `tasks.json`

Forbidden direction:

- handoff prose or raw brainstorm logs becoming implicit tracker truth without
  explicit tracker materialization

Downstream trust gate:

- handoff `status` must be `approved`
- handoff `clarification_status` must be `complete`
- handoff `discussion_clear` must be `true`
- handoff `user_review_status` must be `approved`

Tracker may also project the consumed handoff into optional helper markdown such
as `proposal.md`, but those projections do not replace tracker JSON SSOT.

An approved handoff may carry an optional reviewed `task_plan` using
`bagakit.feature-task-plan.v1`.

- with `task_plan`, tracker may materialize reviewed task truth immediately
- without `task_plan`, tracker must create `proposal` + `proposal_only` state
- an approved handoff is not itself permission to invent executable tasks

## Semantic Task Plan Contract

Active Feature Tracker execution requires explicit version 2 task truth.

Draft `tasks.json` shape:

- `version = 2`
- `plan_status = draft`
- `plan_revision = 0`
- no executable tasks

Reviewed task-plan input schema:

- `schema = bagakit.feature-task-plan.v1`
- approved review evidence
- non-empty repo-relative source references
- one or more semantic tasks

`approved` is an authority claim, not an Agent quality judgment. It means the
user confirmed the requirements during discussion or explicitly delegated the
review decision. The review evidence ref records that confirmation boundary.
An Agent may draft or revise a plan, but it must not self-approve inferred
requirements or treat implementation discoveries as user-authorized scope.

Runtime status vocabulary:

- Feature statuses include `replanning` between active execution and a real
  blocked frontier; it means a cancelled current Task needs a reviewed plan
  revision before the DAG can continue, and `transferred` for a closed partial
  Feature whose remaining work moved to a successor
- Task statuses include `failed` for a disproved approach and `cancelled` for
  an intentionally abandoned or replaced current node; both are terminal
  evidence, not passing results or execution blockers
- Task status `transferred` records an unfinished current-plan node moved with
  its Feature to a reviewed successor; it is terminal historical evidence and
  carries no destination mapping
- `waiting`, `runnable`, `active`, `blocked`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `transferred`, and `done` Task sets
  remain derived from `tasks.json`; only the Task status and its owned reason
  are persisted

Each reviewed task requires:

- `id`, `title`, `objective`, and `outcome`
- optional `depends_on`; omission is canonically equivalent to `[]` and means
  the Task is a graph root
- optional `estimate_hours`, a positive numeric estimate in focused Agent
  execution hours; it is not a human-hours, calendar-time, or queue-time
  estimate
- optional `heavy = true` for an indivisible substructure that is expected to
  exceed the 30-minute shaping target; a heavy Task must also carry a
  non-empty `heavy_reason` and `estimate_hours`
- non-empty acceptance statements
- non-empty verification mappings with `kind`, repo-relative `ref`, and
  `proves`
- non-empty source references
- explicit `supersedes` lineage when it removes tasks from the prior current
  plan

When a Feature is transferred, Feature state carries a `transferred_to` object
containing the successor Feature id. Its current-plan unfinished Tasks are
retained with `status = transferred`; they are historical and cannot be started
or satisfy a dependency. A successor's optional `transferred_from`
list contains objects of the form `{"feature_id":"f-..."}`; it is lineage
context, not Task or Feature dependency truth. Task records only carry the
`status = transferred` marker and no destination mapping.

Required behavior:

- `create-feature --tasks-file` materializes revision 1
- `set-task-plan --expected-revision <n>` fails on stale revision
- workspace assignment and task start fail closed without canonical reviewed
  version 2 task truth
- a task may be started only when it belongs to the latest reviewed plan
- Task array order and Task id order carry no execution-order meaning
- `depends_on` is the only within-Feature ordering truth and a start gate; every dependency
  names a distinct current-plan Task, self-dependencies and cycles are invalid
- a `todo` Task is runnable only when every direct dependency is `done`
- `start-task` atomically claims one runnable Task by moving it to
  `in_progress`; different runnable Tasks may be active at the same time
- every `in_progress`, `blocked`, or `done` current-plan Task requires all of
  its direct dependencies to remain `done`
- `runnable`, active, waiting, blocked-frontier, and completed Task sets are
  derived from `tasks.json` and must not be persisted in `state.json`
- effort fields are planning semantics, not lifecycle or gate truth. They are
  retained in `tasks.json` when supplied, compared during plan revision, and
  may be omitted for Tasks that fit the 30-minute shaping target. A projection
  may use them for a clearly labelled estimated chain, but must not infer
  execution duration from them.
- a task already superseded by a later plan cannot be restarted
- a reviewed plan revision may be installed while Tasks are `in_progress` when
  every active Task remains in the new current plan with identical semantic
  fields and `depends_on`; the revision may add or rewire only Tasks that have
  not started, and removed unstarted Tasks still require explicit supersession
  lineage
- an accidentally started task may return to `todo` only when it has no gate
  evidence or prior blocked/done completion, its persisted owner receipt is
  current, its assigned execution worktree is clean, and its current Git HEAD
  matches the caller's expected HEAD
- restarting a blocked Task clears its latest gate result and command summary;
  prior logs and blocker evidence remain historical, and `done` requires a
  fresh passing gate
- blocked or done task records with execution evidence remain immutable and
  attributable when later plans supersede them
- later revisions compare against the immediately prior current-plan task ids,
  not every historical task record retained in `tasks.json`
- a retained current task may carry supersession lineage already attributed to
  that same task in an earlier revision; the new history entry records only
  tasks removed from the immediately prior current plan
- each revision records supersession ownership by current task; a retained
  owner cannot drop or transfer earlier edges, while replacing that owner
  leaves its earlier ownership immutable in historical revisions
- the expected-HEAD check is an optimistic current-state guard; it does not
  claim that no commit occurred since task start
- active features must use this explicit contract; closed historical features
  may retain their pre-v2 task shape
- a payload that claims `plan_status=reviewed` but fails canonical reviewed
  lineage validation blocks ordinary Feature mutation; owner writes must not
  replace that defect with a derived `task_plan_missing` receipt
- `repair-reviewed-task-plan` is the only canonical repair path for this
  corruption class; it requires exact SHA-256 guards for current state,
  tasks, optional Goal, and receipt plus a complete canonical replacement
- repair preserves `state.json` and the exact set of active Tasks;
  it never lowers the observed plan revision; the explicitly reviewed
  replacement owns repaired task semantics and evidence, and publication
  replaces only `tasks.json` plus the derived receipt in one rollback-safe
  boundary

`set-task-plan` remains a reviewed-plan mutation, not a scheduler. During a
mid-run revision, active Tasks continue under their existing semantics while
newly runnable Tasks are derived from the replacement plan. Executed Task
dependency semantics are immutable across revisions, and an active Task may
not be removed, retitled, or have its acceptance, verification, or direct
dependencies changed by that revision.

Review, source, verification, and evidence references are portable
repo-relative paths. They must reject repository escape, URI paths, drive
absolute paths, and UNC paths.

`review-task-plan` is the read-only plan-quality checkpoint. It enumerates waiting direct edges and failed assumptions, marks waiting edges as requiring a counterfactual decision, and emits the next planning action. It must not infer that an edge is unnecessary, mutate the DAG, or schedule an Agent. A reviewed revision is still required to remove or rewire an edge; its review evidence should cite the checkpoint and the decision-bearing counterfactual.

Feature Tracker owns semantic planning truth and task gate evidence. It does
not own Flow Runner checkpoints, repeated execution scheduling, or normalized
outer-loop work-item history.

Its human status projection may read the latest Flow Runner progress receipt as
an informational overlay. Only an explicit receipt `task_ref` may bind that
overlay to a Task; it never mutates or substitutes `tasks.json` truth.

## Execution Owner Receipt

Feature Tracker writes `owner-receipt.json` beside canonical feature state only
for reviewed execution or Goal continuation. Proposal and draft state without a
Goal do not materialize a receipt.
The shared receipt shape is defined by:

- `docs/specs/execution-owner-receipt-contract.md`

Feature Tracker requirements:

- `owner_kind = feature_tracker`
- `evidence_refs` identify the feature's `state.json` and `tasks.json`
- when `goal_contract` exists, `evidence_refs` also identifies `goal.md`
- `evidence_hashes` bind each evidence ref to the SHA-256 digest of its final
  canonical file bytes
- `semantic_revision` is the SHA-256 digest of the compact canonical JSON over
  owner identity, lifecycle, continuation, active items, blockers,
  replacement ref, and `evidence_hashes`
- `save_feat` writes canonical state and tasks before refreshing the derived
  receipt
- a missing required receipt, stale receipt, or evidence hash drift fails
  closed
- `ready` and valid `in_progress` state map to `continue`; `replanning` maps to
  a blocked continuation with the owner-level `replan_required` action
- active item ids, Task blockers, and replanning state are derived from
  `tasks.json`; runnable ids stay out of the receipt because it is not an
  execution plan
- missing reviewed plan or missing workspace maps to blocked continuation
- a replacement points to the repo-relative replacement owner receipt, not a
  bare feature id

The receipt is a derived owner handoff. It does not become task SSOT and does
not authorize a consumer to mutate Feature Tracker.

## Feature Root File Policy

Feature roots are not general-purpose documentation buckets.

Allowed live-feature root files:

- `state.json`
- `tasks.json`
- `owner-receipt.json`
- optional canonical `goal.md`
- optional `proposal.md`
- optional `spec-delta.md`
- optional `verification.md`

Allowed live-feature root directories:

- optional `artifacts/`

Allowed closeout-only root files:

- `summary.md`

Allowed canonical files in both live and closed feature roots:

- `goal.md` when `state.json.goal_contract` exists

Rules:

- unsupported feature-root files must be rejected by validation
- unsupported feature-root directories must be rejected by validation
- an orphan, missing, malformed, wrongly bound, or hash-drifted `goal.md` must
  be rejected by validation
- `summary.md` is a closeout artifact and must not appear in active feature
  roots
- closed feature roots must contain `summary.md`
- the canonical `summary.md` must not restate `state.json.goal` or synthesize
  requirement prose from execution; it points to the reviewed `tasks.json`
  plan revision and its review evidence ref instead
- when no reviewed plan exists, `summary.md` records no confirmed plan revision
  and must not infer requirements from proposal or discard context
- Agent-authored closeout learning must be labeled as execution learning and
  must not redefine confirmed requirements
- closeout keeps canonical `goal.md` at the closed Feature root and updates
  `goal_contract.ref` plus owner receipt hashes to the closed path
- live-feature helper files such as `proposal.md`, `spec-delta.md`, and
  `verification.md` are not valid in closed feature roots
- closeout should preserve legacy or live-only root entries by moving them
  under `artifacts/closeout-preserved-root/` before the feature is finalized
- if an active feature root already contains `summary.md`, closeout should
  preserve that operator-authored file under
  `artifacts/closeout-preserved-root/summary.md` before writing the canonical
  closed summary
- `PRD.md` and `Changelog.md` are not supported feature-root artifacts under
  the current contract
- feature intent or scope that would otherwise drift into `PRD.md` should route
  to `proposal.md` or an upstream planning artifact
- change history that would otherwise drift into `Changelog.md` should route to
  repo or release surfaces; feature closeout narrative belongs in `summary.md`
- `ui-verification.md` is retired; validation should point operators to
  `verification.md`
- if another artifact class becomes canonical later, it must be introduced
  through the contract instead of appearing ad hoc in feature roots

## Dependency Projection Contract

`show-feature-dag` emits an on-demand generated projection.

It is not:

- canonical feature truth
- an operator-edited planning file
- a runtime execution history surface
- a policy-resolved scheduling plan

Stable current payload shape:

- `version`
- `generated_by`
- `features`
  - `feat_id`
  - `depends_on`
  - `dependents`
  - `layer`
  - `transferred_from`
- `layers`
  - `layer`
  - `feat_ids`
- `notes`

Required generation rules:

- generate from active non-archived feature state
- use `state.json.depends_on` as canonical dependency truth
- `state.json.depends_on` must be a list when present
- derive dependents and pure topological layers from that truth
- treat archived dependencies as already satisfied and record that as a note
- fail closed on discarded or transferred dependencies
- record missing active dependencies as notes instead of silently inventing
  graph nodes

Forbidden content in dependency projection output:

- policy-resolved execution mode
- parallelism limits
- execution recommendations
- progress or resume cursors that belong to a separate execution-plan or
  runtime-history surface

Generation and mutation rule:

- the tracker must compute dependency projection directly from canonical
  feature state
- graph-affecting commands must validate the resulting active DAG before they
  persist canonical state changes or move a feature into closed storage
- `replan-features` must validate the complete proposed graph before persisting
  any changed `state.json.depends_on` values
- validation must recompute the active graph and reject invalid dependency
  values, discarded dependencies, and cycles
- projection output is disposable and must not be required for later mutation,
  validation, recovery, or closeout

## Workspace Mode Contract

Stable workspace modes are:

- `proposal_only`
- `current_tree`
- `worktree`

Required invariants:

- `proposal_only` carries no dedicated branch or worktree assignment
- `current_tree` carries no dedicated branch or worktree assignment
- `worktree` carries branch, worktree name, and worktree path together
- `assign-feature-workspace --workspace-mode worktree` creates a new dedicated
  worktree; it does not adopt an existing one
- `adopt-feature-worktree` is the only Tracker transition that binds an
  already registered Git worktree or replaces a stale worktree assignment
- worktree adoption requires a reviewed Task plan, a current owner receipt, no
  active Task, an existing registered worktree under the same Git repository,
  and an exact checked-out branch match
- worktree adoption only updates canonical workspace state, history, index, and
  the derived owner receipt; it must not create, delete, move, clean, check out,
  or otherwise modify the adopted Git worktree
- adopted worktree paths are stored relative to the tracker root so canonical
  Tracker truth does not retain a machine-local absolute path

Workspace assignment determines the execution root for task gates:

- `worktree` features execute task gates from the assigned worktree path
- `current_tree` features execute task gates from the repository root supplied
  to the tracker command
- `proposal_only` features must not run task gates against a hidden
  implementation tree

The mode set is part of tracker contract, not a transient implementation detail.

## Concurrency Contract

Tracker state mutation must be serialized at the repository level.

Required behavior:

- concurrent tracker commands must not corrupt `features.json`, `state.json`,
  or `tasks.json`
- long-running task-gate execution must not hold the global tracker
  state lock for the whole external command duration
- task-gate commands must capture the feature workspace assignment
  before executing external commands and revalidate that assignment before
  writing results back to tracker state
- a task gate must execute the current Task's non-empty `verification` entries
  with `kind = command`; a Task with no executable verification must record
  `fail`
- new reviewed plans must include at least one executable command mapping per
  Task; existing reviewed plans with only artifact, manual, or owner-receipt
  mappings remain readable but fail closed when that Task is started or gated
  until the plan is revised
- historical completed Tasks and their earlier gate receipts remain readable;
  the new receipt match is enforced on the `finish-task` transition rather
  than by retroactively invalidating or migrating closed Task evidence
- `state.json.gate.last_check_commands` and the Task's `last_gate_commands`
  must contain exactly those declared Task commands, in declaration order
- runtime-policy command profiles (`gate.ui_commands` and
  `gate.non_ui_commands`) are retired and rejected; they cannot authorize a
  Task or form a second completion standard
- `finish-task --result done` rejects a stale or mismatched gate receipt even
  when `gate_result` was manually left as `pass`; rerunning the Task gate is
  required after its verification commands change
- workspace assignment must not be changed while a feature has an `in_progress`
  task
- feature discard must not close or clean up a feature while any Task is
  `in_progress`; all active Tasks must be finished first
- worktree execution must verify that the assigned worktree path is a registered
  Git worktree and that its checked-out branch matches feature state

Normal locked transitions publish coherent state, task, receipt, and index
files. They are separate atomic file replacements, not a crash-atomic
multi-file transaction; receipt/hash drift and validation fail closed after an
interrupted publication.

One Feature may have multiple simultaneous `in_progress` Tasks. Tracker owns
their atomic status transitions, but not Worker assignment, concurrency limits,
Task worktrees, merge order, or shared-tree conflict resolution. One Feature
workspace remains the integrated candidate truth; a Task becomes `done` only
after its result is integrated there and its gate passes.

## Optional Artifact Rule

The tracker may materialize optional helper files from canonical templates.

Current optional helper artifacts are:

- `proposal.md`
- `spec-delta.md`
- `verification.md`

Rules:

- none of these files are required in the default feature layout
- their presence must not redefine `state.json` or `tasks.json`
- `verification.md` is generic evidence, not a UI-only special case
- closed features must not materialize or retain these live-feature helper files
  at the feature root
- the default gate policy is `verification_policy = on_demand`, which means
  `verification.md` is only checked when the file exists unless a stricter
  policy is configured; this Feature-level evidence is supplemental and never
  replaces the current Task's declared command gate
- checked verification evidence must not retain blank template fields; it must
  include a substantive automated result or manual outcome and an explicit
  residual-risk disposition

Materialize `verification.md` when:

- a task needs manual checks that are not already captured by automated
  commands
- screenshots, interactive review notes, rollout observations, or residual risk
  notes matter to acceptance
- tracker policy is configured to require explicit verification evidence

Keep evidence only in `tasks.json` and gate logs when:

- all acceptance checks are already covered by automated commands
- no additional human evidence is needed beyond pass/fail command output

Migration note:

- `ui-verification.md` is superseded by `verification.md`
- current tracker contract expects `verification.md`
- active feature roots carrying the old filename should rename it before
  rerunning gate
- closed feature roots should preserve legacy `ui-verification.md` under
  `artifacts/closeout-preserved-root/` instead of restoring it at the root
- tracker validation should provide a direct rename hint for this migration

## Closeout Rule

`archive-feature`, `discard-feature`, and `closeout-feature` are public
closeout commands.

`transfer-feature` is the explicit partial-closeout command. It requires an
existing active successor with a reviewed Task plan and a successor-side
`transferred_from` backlink. It stages the old Feature under
`features-transferred/`, keeps completed Tasks as `done`, marks unfinished
current-plan Tasks `transferred`, and records `transferred_to`; it does
not mutate the successor's plan or invent a requirement summary.

Runtime truth and Git truth are separate surfaces:

- tracker commands may mutate tracker runtime state
- Feature Tracker does not generate commit prose, execute Git commits, or
  persist commit identity; ordinary Git or `bagakit-git-message-craft` owns
  those concerns
- a code commit is not the tracked feature completion boundary

Stable closeout expectations:

- `diagnose-tracker --closeout-plan` remains read-only and emits loadable
  closeout candidates even when validation finds unrelated active-state errors;
  the command must still return non-zero while those errors remain
- `closeout-feature` defaults to a dry-run plan and requires `--execute` before
  it changes tracker state
- every archive or discard requires one explicit closeout review with three
  resolved items:
  - `documentation`: `updated`, `verified_current`, or `not_applicable`
  - `learning`: `candidates_reviewed` or `no_reusable_learning`
  - `promotion`: `routed_for_review`, `promoted`, or `not_needed`
- every item requires a non-empty rationale; `updated`, `verified_current`,
  `candidates_reviewed`, `routed_for_review`, and `promoted` also require one
  or more portable repo-relative evidence refs
- `no_reusable_learning` may pair only with `not_needed`; Tracker rejects a
  claim that learning was both absent and routed or promoted
- documentation review starts from changed behavior and the owning project
  SSOT; requirement changes may be written only from user-confirmed discussion
  or explicitly delegated review evidence, never from Agent inference; it must
  not force an unrelated document edit merely to close a Feature
- learning review is bounded to useful execution evidence such as task-plan
  revisions, gate failures, user corrections, and final receipts or artifacts;
  it compares the original intent and non-goals with delivered scope, checks
  whether the shortest useful vertical closure preceded expansion, and treats
  repeated scope growth, missing stop rules, or task-count growth without a
  quality gain as corrected-belief candidates; the Agent may summarize these
  candidates independently, but must merge duplicates, keep them concise, and
  never promote them into requirements without user confirmation
- raw session transcripts remain with their host and are not copied into
  Feature Tracker; only bounded refs and reviewed candidate conclusions may
  cross into closeout truth
- before durable promotion, merge same-class candidates and route the result
  through the repository's existing Chronicle, Evolver, Principle Layer, or
  Living Knowledge owner as applicable; Feature Tracker does not create a
  competing knowledge or policy store
- the canonical review is written once as `tasks.json.closeout_review` using
  schema `bagakit.feature-closeout-review.v1`; `summary.md` projects it, and
  the existing execution-owner receipt binds it through the final
  `tasks.json` hash
- closeout review publication is part of the existing staged closeout
  transaction; a rejected or failed closeout must not leave review state in
  the active Feature
- tracked feature completion means the feature reaches `archived`,
  `discarded`, or `transferred`, or the operator leaves an explicit active
  reason such as `blocked`
- `finish-task` returning `feat_status=done` is a closeout-pending result, not
  terminal Feature completion; the command emits `closeout_required=true` and
  the next closeout action so a Host can keep the convergence loop alive
- an active `done` Feature's owner receipt uses `continuation=blocked` with the
  owner-level `closeout_required` blocker; `continuation=complete` is reserved
  for an archived Feature
- archived features move into `features-archived/`
- discarded features move into `features-discarded/`
- transferred features move into `features-transferred/`
- closeout summaries live with the closed feature directory
- live-only or unsupported legacy root entries should be preserved under
  `artifacts/closeout-preserved-root/`
- archive and discard must validate the post-closeout active DAG before they
  move the feature directory
- archive and discard must construct and validate the complete deterministic
  closed Feature state, including Task evidence and the absence of live
  cursor or blocker mirrors,
  derived index and owner receipt, canonical summary, and preserved-root
  projection before the directory move
- closeout stages the complete closed Feature directory before a short
  directory switch; an ordinary staging or publication failure must restore
  the active placement and leave the active control files and index unchanged
- archive and discard do not remove or prune worktrees, delete branches, or
  export Git patches; explicit ordinary Git commands own Git cleanup before or
  after Tracker closeout
- an assigned worktree that still exists must be registered and clean at
  closeout; a missing unregistered worktree is accepted as already cleaned,
  while a missing registered worktree fails closed for ordinary Git repair
- only archive closeout of an `in_progress` Task may consume `--task`,
  `--result`, or blocker arguments; discard and non-active closeout reject
  those unused arguments
- `current_tree` archive may proceed with unrelated non-harness repo changes
  because archive only closes tracker metadata and does not preserve or delete
  implementation files
- `current_tree` discard must still fail closed on non-harness repo changes
  because Tracker closeout must not hide unpreserved work
- `discard-feature --reason invalid` is the narrow exception for a readable,
  active, but contract-invalid Feature: the command must reject a valid Feature,
  preserve every original Feature-root entry under
  `artifacts/invalid-source/`, publish a minimal discarded tombstone through
  the existing staged closeout transaction, and leave Git workspaces unchanged
- archive/discard idempotent reruns must fail closed when directory placement
  disagrees with the claimed closed status
- idempotent reruns reuse and validate the already published closeout review;
  they do not require or accept a second review record
- closed features must not remain in `features/`

The tracker must fail closed if active and closed directory placement disagree
with indexed feature status.

## Protected Boundaries

This contract intentionally rejects several easier but lower-quality shortcuts.

- Feature ids do not carry slug or timestamp semantics.
- Local issuer state does not become tracked planning truth.
- Dependency projection output does not replace feature state or embed
  policy-resolved execution planning.
- Unsupported feature-root prose files must not become shadow tracker truth.
- External bridge logic does not ship inside the canonical tracker contract.
