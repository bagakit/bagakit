# Bagakit Researcher

`bagakit-researcher` is the Bagakit runtime surface for evidence production.

It should stay:

- standalone-first
- independently distributable
- independently usable without a mandatory knowledge or evolver system
- provider-agnostic
- explicit about research drift risk

## When To Use

Use this skill when a repository needs:

- one local-first research loop instead of repeated ad hoc searching
- a topic charter that anchors the question before search starts
- a survey packet that decomposes the question and source landscape before broad retrieval
- a bounded research pass that can be split into parallel tracks
- preserved source cards for important material
- reusable per-source summaries
- explicit claim, insight, and lead records
- warning-first quality and drift checks
- topic indexes that tell the next operator what already exists
- explicit separation between research evidence and later promotion

Do not use this skill when:

- you only need one quick lookup and no durable local research record
- the work is already mature shared knowledge that belongs directly in the shared knowledge root
- the work is a repository-evolution decision topic that should live in `evolver`

## Route Ladder

Use the smallest researcher route that protects the task:

- Quick lookup:
  - do not open a researcher topic unless durable evidence is needed.
- Survey:
  - use `plan-survey` when the question, source landscape, rankings, seed
    queries, or blind spots must be mapped before broad retrieval.
- Bounded pass:
  - use `plan-pass` when the scope is clear enough to collect and preserve
    evidence.
- Parallel tracks:
  - use track contracts only when the topic genuinely decomposes into disjoint
    work packages.
- Synthesis or handoff:
  - use claims, insights, leads, synthesis, and handoff files to compress
    evidence for the next owner without promoting it automatically.

## Boundary

This skill does:

- create and maintain topic-scoped research workspaces
- create a topic charter, research passes, and track contracts
- create survey packets for pre-retrieval question decomposition, source-landscape mapping, and provider-agnostic retrieval planning
- keep local-first research behavior explicit
- preserve important source cards
- write reusable summaries
- keep claims, cross-source insights, and active-mining leads visible
- run warning-first quality and drift checks
- refresh topic indexes
- render optional handoff artifacts
- produce evidence that may later feed `bagakit-living-knowledge` or `bagakit-skill-evolver`

This skill does not:

- own shared project knowledge
- own repository-system evolution memory
- orchestrate web, social, database, or model providers
- launch or supervise subagents
- decide durable promotion on its own
- mutate `bagakit-living-knowledge`, `bagakit-skill-evolver`, or
  `bagakit-skill-selector` workspaces on its own
- require another Bagakit skill in default mode

## Output Discipline

Follow `docs/specs/output-discipline.md` inside topic workspaces.
Follow `docs/specs/principle-layer-contract.md` when research evidence is
synthesized into Bagakit-facing guidance.

- charter the question before broad search
- create a survey packet before non-trivial broad source collection when the field, source landscape, or unknowns are still unclear
- keep source summaries source-bound; promote only claim-backed conclusions
- record counterevidence or confidence limits for recommendations
- use `doctor --quality --drift` before synthesis or downstream handoff
- turn recurring research drift into warnings or checks, not hidden heuristics
- keep `SKILL.md` as the concise route and trigger surface; put field-level
  contracts in references
- treat external research-agent products and skill specs as source evidence:
  preserve what to borrow, what to avoid, and the Bagakit implication before
  changing researcher behavior
- separate observed source claims from Bagakit-facing inferences, and record
  the inference's `why`, intended generalization, limitations, and transfer
  checks before handoff

## Runtime Surface Declaration

- top-level runtime surface root when materialized:
  - `.bagakit/researcher/`
- shared path protocol file:
  - `docs/.bagakit-knowledge.toml`
- stable contract:
  - `docs/specs/runtime-surface-contract.md`
- if the top-level root exists in a host repo, it should carry `surface.toml`

## Core Surfaces

Researcher uses the configured `researcher_root` when `docs/.bagakit-knowledge.toml` exists.

Current default:

- `.bagakit/researcher`

Each topic lives under:

- `<researcher_root>/topics/<topic-class>/<topic>/`

Researcher may also maintain a researcher-local wiki/frontdoor:

- `<researcher_root>/index.md`
- `<researcher_root>/wiki/`

Rule:

- `researcher_root` may override the default path only when it stays under
  `.bagakit/`
- hidden `docs/.<topic-class>/...` roots are not valid Bagakit researcher
  runtime paths
- `topics/` remains the evidence source of truth
- `wiki/` is a derived navigation and synthesis frontdoor over topic evidence,
  not shared checked-in knowledge and not repository evolution memory
- before opening a new topic, pass, or broad search, inspect the existing
  researcher frontdoor when it exists or can be refreshed from prior topics
- a researcher that reads the wiki inherits a maintenance duty for the current
  research loop: before final response or handoff, update topic evidence first,
  refresh the topic index, refresh the wiki, and run `doctor --wiki`
- wiki maintenance means regenerating from topic artifacts, not hand-editing
  generated wiki pages as the source of truth

Base topic members:

- `originals/`
  - source cards and preserved source references
- `summaries/`
  - reusable per-source summaries
- `index.md`
  - topic map, reading order, and managed artifact lists

Extended workflow members are created by the command that needs them.
`init-topic --extended` creates optional directories and empty ledgers only;
`plan-survey` creates a survey packet, and `plan-pass` creates the charter,
pass file, and initial tracks.

- `charter.md`
  - stable topic anchor: question, scope, non-goals, evidence threshold, stop rule
- `surveys/`
  - pre-retrieval survey packets for question decomposition, four-quadrant uncertainty, source landscape, ranking or seed-list strategy, source-quality heuristics, stop rules, and handback conditions
- `passes/`
  - bounded research-pass plans that can be reviewed before execution
- `tracks/`
  - parallel work contracts with owned outputs and drift checks
- `claims.md`
  - claim ledger with evidence refs, confidence, and counterevidence
- `insights/`
  - cross-source or cross-track interpretations
- `leads.md`
  - active-mining backlog with expected value, stop rule, and outcome
- `handoffs/`
  - optional downstream handoff artifacts

Frontdoor members are refreshed by `refresh-wiki`:

- `index.md`
  - root-level researcher frontdoor across topics
- `wiki/README.md`
  - wiki boundary, update rule, and coverage map
- `wiki/concepts/`
  - cross-topic concept indexes
- `wiki/questions/`
  - open question and lead indexes
- `wiki/claims/`
  - claim indexes that point back to topic claim ledgers

## Optimized Flow

The normal workflow is:

1. Before new research, refresh or inspect the researcher frontdoor and read
   relevant existing topic, question, and claim links.
2. Create or update `charter.md`.
3. If the question needs field mapping before retrieval, create one survey
   packet under `surveys/`.
4. Plan one bounded pass under `passes/`.
5. Split the pass into track contracts under `tracks/`.
6. Execute track work outside researcher; parallel workers should write only their owned track files, source ids, and summaries.
7. Add source cards under `originals/` and reusable summaries under `summaries/`.
8. Record sourced claims in `claims.md`, cross-source insights under `insights/`, and active-mining leads in `leads.md`.
9. Run `doctor --quality` and `doctor --drift` before synthesis or handoff.
10. Refresh the managed sections of `index.md` without overwriting curated notes.
11. Refresh the researcher-local wiki/frontdoor when cross-topic discovery
   matters.
12. If the loop read the wiki and changed topic evidence, close the maintenance
    duty with `doctor --wiki` before final response or handoff.
13. Optionally render a handoff artifact under `handoffs/`.

Researcher may generate retrieval plans and query sketches, but provider
execution belongs outside this skill.

## Commands

0. Before new search, inspect the existing researcher frontdoor:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh refresh-wiki --root .
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh list-topics --root .
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh doctor --root . --wiki
```

Read `<researcher_root>/index.md` and relevant pages under
`<researcher_root>/wiki/` before deciding whether to open a new topic or extend
an existing one.

1. Initialize one topic workspace:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh init-topic \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --title "Researcher Skill"
```

2. Plan a pre-retrieval survey when broad source collection is not yet ready:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh plan-survey \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --survey-id survey-001 \
  --charter-question "How should researcher support field survey before broad source collection?" \
  --question "How should researcher survey a field before broad source collection?" \
  --why-needed "The source landscape and blind spots are not yet clear" \
  --problem-dimension "question decomposition" \
  --known-known "The topic charter exists" \
  --known-unknown "The best source classes are not yet known" \
  --unknown-known "The agent suspects ranking pages may be useful" \
  --unknown-unknown "The field may have hidden benchmark or practitioner sources" \
  --source-landscape "official docs, curated lists, benchmarks, indexes" \
  --ranking-lead "field rankings or benchmark leaderboards" \
  --quality-heuristic "prefer primary or owner-maintained sources" \
  --seed-query "field survey best sources benchmark list" \
  --stop-condition "enough routes exist to plan one bounded pass" \
  --drift-check "survey still answers the charter question" \
  --handoff-target "passes/pass-001.md"
```

`plan-survey` writes a pre-retrieval packet under `surveys/`. It creates or
replaces `charter.md` only when `--charter-question` is provided, because the
survey-routing question is often narrower than the topic anchor. The packet
does not execute search, call providers, or replace source cards, summaries,
claims, or pass planning.
The four-quadrant fields borrow the consensus-ledger lens as local survey
fields; they do not create a mandatory `bagakit-consensus-ledger` dependency.

3. Plan one bounded research pass:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh plan-pass \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --pass-id pass-001 \
  --question "How should researcher support parallel anti-drift research?" \
  --track "source-scan:compare external research skills" \
  --track "runtime-model:define local artifact contracts"
```

`plan-pass` creates or updates the charter scaffolding, one pass file, track
contracts, and supporting ledgers without launching workers.

4. Add or list track contracts:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh add-track \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --track-id source-scan \
  --pass-id pass-001 \
  --question "Which external skill patterns reduce research drift?"

sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh list-tracks \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill
```

Track files are concurrency contracts. They should identify the question,
owned output files, source-id range, evidence threshold, lead policy, and drift
check for one worker or subagent.

5. Add one source card:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh add-source-card \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --source-id a01 \
  --title "Example Source" \
  --url "https://example.com" \
  --authority primary \
  --published unknown \
  --source-role primary \
  --scope-fit core \
  --limitations "sample limitation" \
  --why "sets the baseline for the topic"
```

Source cards should preserve source role, authority, scope fit, limitations,
and why the source was kept.

6. Add one reusable summary:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh add-summary \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --source-id a01 \
  --title "Example Source Summary" \
  --why-matters "it clarifies the core pattern" \
  --borrow "one strong reusable idea" \
  --avoid "one wrong direction" \
  --implication "one Bagakit-specific consequence"
```

Summaries stay source-bound. Do not turn a source summary into a Bagakit
decision unless the claim is also recorded in `claims.md`.

7. Record claims, insights, and leads:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh add-claim \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --claim-id c001 \
  --kind observation \
  --statement "Parallel tracks reduce write conflicts when outputs are owned." \
  --evidence-ref "tracks/source-scan.md"

sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh add-insight \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --insight-id i001 \
  --title "Track contracts are the parallelism primitive" \
  --insight "Track contracts are the parallelism primitive." \
  --source-claim c001

sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh add-lead \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --lead-id l001 \
  --originating-artifact "insights/i001.md" \
  --hypothesis "Compare another research skill family" \
  --expected-value "may reveal missing drift checks" \
  --stop-rule "stop after one representative source"
```

Claims distinguish observation, inference, and recommendation. Insights should
name supporting claims and counterclaims. Leads keep proactive mining bounded.

8. Run warning-first checks:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh doctor \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --quality \
  --drift
```

`doctor --quality` checks structural completeness. `doctor --drift` surfaces
ungrounded claims, weak recommendations, context-only evidence used as a
decision basis, unchecked leads, and track scope drift. These checks should warn
before they become hard gates.

9. Refresh the topic index:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh refresh-index \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --title "Researcher Skill"
```

`refresh-index` owns only managed artifact sections. It must not overwrite
operator-written topic goals, reading order, conclusions, or open questions.

10. Refresh the researcher-local wiki/frontdoor:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh refresh-wiki \
  --root . \
  --title "Researcher Frontdoor"
```

`refresh-wiki` writes researcher-local derived pages under `<researcher_root>/`.
Every meaningful wiki page should point back to topic evidence under `topics/`.
The wiki is not a replacement for topic workspaces and is not the shared
knowledge root.
If this loop read the wiki and changed topic evidence, this refresh is a
required closeout step, not an optional cleanup.

11. Confirm the wiki maintenance closeout:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh doctor --root . --wiki
```

12. Optionally render one handoff artifact:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh render-handoff \
  --root . \
  --topic-class frontier \
  --topic researcher-skill \
  --kind evolver
```

Supported handoff kinds are `selector`, `evolver`, and `living-knowledge`.
Rendering a handoff writes a file under `handoffs/`; it does not mutate the
target system.

13. Before another new search, inspect what already exists:

```bash
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh list-topics --root .
sh scripts/bagakit-researcher.sh doctor --root . --wiki
```

## Handoff

If another system needs the result, hand off explicitly:

- `bagakit-living-knowledge`
  - ingest reviewed summaries or conclusions into the shared knowledge root
- `bagakit-skill-evolver`
  - attach the research workspace as optional local context or summarize key sources into topic state
- `bagakit-skill-selector`
  - record `bagakit-researcher` as a task candidate and log whether the research pass helped

These handoffs are optional and contract-driven.
Standard cross-skill combinations should be expressed through
`bagakit-skill-selector/recipes/`, not hidden as researcher-side runtime
coupling.

## Footer Contract

When the surrounding workflow explicitly asks for research-task reporting, it may use:

```text
[[BAGAKIT]]
- Researcher: Topic=<topic-class/topic>; Evidence=<index + surveys/source cards/summaries>; Next=<one deterministic next action>
```
