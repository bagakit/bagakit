<!-- BAGAKIT:LIVING-KNOWLEDGE:START -->
This is a managed block for `bagakit-living-knowledge`. Do not hand-edit the
managed region directly; refresh it through the skill operator instead.

Resolve the installed skill dir before using the operator directly:

- `export BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR="<path-to-bagakit-living-knowledge-skill>"`

Boot layer:

- Read the resolved `must-guidebook.md` before relying on memory.
- If a task needs shared knowledge rules, read `must-authority.md`.
- If a task needs prior decisions or facts, follow `must-recall.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` is only the bootstrap layer; the shared checked-in knowledge root
  is configured in `.bagakit/knowledge_conf.toml`.

Recall discipline:

- Search first:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" recall search --root . '<query>'`
- Then inspect only the needed lines:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" recall get --root . <path> --from <line> --lines <n>`
- Prefer quoting only needed lines over paraphrasing from memory.

Substrate discipline:

- Shared knowledge belongs under the configured shared root.
- Research runtime belongs to `bagakit-researcher`.
- Task-level composition/runtime belongs to `bagakit-skill-selector`.
- Repository evolution memory belongs to `bagakit-skill-evolver`.
- `living-knowledge` owns path protocol, normalization, indexing, and recall.

Inspection helpers:

- View the resolved path protocol:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" paths --root .`
- Refresh the guidebook and helper map:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" index --root .`
- Run non-destructive diagnostics:
  - `sh "$BAGAKIT_LIVING_KNOWLEDGE_SKILL_DIR/scripts/bagakit-living-knowledge.sh" doctor --root .`

If the surrounding workflow explicitly asks for `living-knowledge` task
reporting, the response footer may use:

- `[[BAGAKIT]]`
- `- LivingKnowledge: Surface=<updated shared surfaces or none>; Evidence=<commands/checks>; Next=<one deterministic next action>`
