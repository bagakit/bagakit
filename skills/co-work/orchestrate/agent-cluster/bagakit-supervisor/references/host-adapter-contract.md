# Host Adapter Contract

Stable authority: `docs/specs/supervisor-skill-contract.md`. This file is a
conditional operational projection; the stable spec wins on conflict.

Use this reference before supervising through an unfamiliar Agent host or
moving supervision between hosts.

## Portable Capability Set

A host adapter may provide:

- `dispatch`: start one bounded attempt with explicit role and authority
- `observe`: return current process or task evidence
- `wait`: block until a material event or bounded deadline
- `message`: steer an active attempt without changing its identity when the
  host supports that behavior; preserve the L1 Agent message envelope and
  expose sender and controller-binding evidence separately
- `notify_user`: deliver one user-facing update through the current logical
  route while exposing accepted, delivered, failed, or unknown state
- `cancel`: stop or freeze an attempt
- `fence`: reject completion from a stale attempt capability
- `read_state`: return authoritative host task and attempt state

The skill must inspect available capabilities instead of assuming all exist.

## Canonical Execution Adapter

For a host that exposes provider-specific concepts such as profiles, roles,
runs, sessions, panes, or viewer tabs, normalize them into one execution
record before the Supervisor makes a control decision. The record is the
adapter's projection; it is not a second lifecycle store.

The minimum projection is:

- `execution_ref`: stable host execution identity
- `attempt_id`: current Supervisor attempt identity
- `worker_id`: authenticated worker or controller identity when available
- `authority`: writable or read-only capability and current writer binding
- `target`: owner revision, workspace or launch root, and candidate identity
- `assignment`: result predicate, return path, and next observation condition
- `state`: queued, running, waiting, succeeded, failed, cancelled, dead, or stale
- `evidence`: latest artifact, verification, review, failure, and effect refs
- `report`: the latest structured Worker result, kept distinct from Host state

Provider fields remain Host-owned metadata. A profile name does not become a
Supervisor role, a process id does not become a worker identity, a run label
does not become an attempt identity, and a viewer or transcript does not become
state. The adapter may retain those fields for diagnosis, but the Supervisor
must not branch on them when the normalized record already answers the current
control question.

Use one operation path for the common execution loop:

1. `dispatch` returns the normalized execution record and the first response
   or assimilation evidence when available.
2. `wait` waits for a declared result predicate, failure, effect, or bounded
   staleness event; it does not require periodic narration.
3. `read_state` refreshes the same record and is the authority for current
   lifecycle state.
4. `message`, `cancel`, and `fence` act on `execution_ref` plus `attempt_id`,
   never on a display name, label, pane, or stale process handle alone.
5. `report` contributes evidence to the record but cannot change its state or
   authority without Host observation.

This projection absorbs a hybrid executor such as profile → role → run →
result without importing its CLI, prompt templates, or viewer model into the
Supervisor. It also removes duplicate decisions: the Supervisor chooses the
result predicate and control action; the Host chooses the provider, process,
session, and observation implementation.

If a host cannot produce the normalized record, mark the missing fields
unknown and degrade the affected action. Do not recreate a second mini-runner
inside the Supervisor to fill the gap.

Before `cancel`, `fence`, replacement, release, or any equivalent terminal
control, the adapter should expose in one fresh state read both the current
Supervisor controller session/terminal identity and the requested target
session/terminal identity, including their worktree or run binding when the
Host has it. If the target matches the current Supervisor session, or identity
comparison is unavailable or stale, reject the requested control operation
instead of guessing from a handle, name, or task label. Host safety enforcement
may still apply through a separate authenticated path.

For user communication, the adapter should preserve the current logical route,
cadence, maximum staleness, language, explanation level, emphasis, special
constraints, source revision, and last admitted report state separately from
provider-local channel configuration. The Host owns user identity,
authentication, credentials, concrete delivery, and readback. Do not claim
delivery from invocation alone. A failed or unknown delivery does not erase the
Supervisor's conclusion or silently authorize an unbound route.

For unfinished voluntary stop, the Host should expose one current Owner
instruction on an authenticated route, bound to the exact Goal, controller,
action, checkpoint, and consequence. Require a second confirmation only for an
irreversible external effect or unresolved identity ambiguity. Message text and
markup are not authentication; keep forced Host or safety containment on a
separate path from Owner closure.

## Required Topology Evidence

Before Supervisor changes team topology, the adapter should expose a bounded
current view of the relevant attempts or roles:

- role, target attempt, candidate identity, and current authority
- current assignment and declared result predicate
- material liveness state and latest artifact, evidence, verdict, or absence
- waiting predicate or maximum-staleness boundary
- current workload or blocking predicate when known
- duplicate assignment, stale target, authority conflict, and write overlap

This view is admission evidence for one dispatch decision, not a portable team
registry. The Host remains the authority for live identities, capabilities,
load, cancellation, and fencing. Missing telemetry is unknown, not idle.

A role is not usable capacity merely because it was spawned, acknowledged a
prompt, has a process, emitted tool activity, or reached process completion.
Its declared result predicate must be current or still credibly in progress.
When a result is missing, expose enough failure state for the Supervisor to
inspect before duplicate dispatch, reassignment, or replacement.

## Required Dispatch Evidence

Before treating an attempt as running, establish:

- owner ref and observed revision
- attempt and worker identity
- role and writable or read-only authority
- launch or task root
- mutation boundary
- provider and model when quality or fallback policy depends on them
- execution domain used to scope shared circuit breaking
- observable handle
- host-specific completion or fencing capability when available

A returned task id, tmux session, pane, process id, or tool call alone does not
prove the worker received the prompt, has correct permissions, or is current.

After dispatch, preserve the current Owner, assignment, and acceptance refs
alongside the Worker's first material response when the Host can expose it.
That evidence lets the Supervisor check bounded goal assimilation without
turning the Host into a semantic grader. The Host need not parse a fixed
template; it only preserves attribution and current target identity.

Before a derived Agent acts, deliver its validated L1 `agent-set-v1` Set. When
the delivery channel appears to that Agent as appended `user` or prompt input,
the Set and later Agent-authored messages use `bagakit-msg`, not raw text. A
native structured Agent result with reliable sender metadata does not need a
second wrapper. The Host binds which authorized sender and ordering make a Set
current; the XML does not grant authority.

For later Worker reports, preserve sender, target attempt, candidate identity,
and receipt time separately from the visible L1 message. The semantic report
profile may help the Supervisor read the result, evidence, mismatch, and next
action; it does not replace Host attribution or prove the reported fact.

Before delivering a Supervisor message, the Host should bind:

- Supervisor controller identity and visible `name`
- current Owner ref and revision
- target task and attempt
- whether this Supervisor is the action-authorized controller for that target
- any internal correlation or deduplication identity, accepted/delivered state,
  and transport evidence

For a Host that can provide a transactional message operation, the input
should bind one stable operation key to the controller, Owner ref and revision,
task, target attempt, expected Host state version, visible name, and body. The
Host should reserve the target's unique open-intervention slot before calling
transport, render and validate the unchanged XML envelope, and persist its
digest and state evidence. The same key is an idempotent read or resume; a
different key is rejected while the effect is open or unresolved. A transport
timeout stays unknown and open rather than authorizing another call.

Keep three state axes separate:

- delivery: not attempted, accepted, delivered, or unknown
- consumption: unknown or consumed
- effect: open, resolved, or unresolved

A worker acknowledgement may advance only consumption. Effect resolution
requires a post-delivery Host, artifact, external, or independent-review oracle
bound to the current attempt and candidate identity. The portable
`intervention_refs[]` and `effect_refs[]` may point at these Host receipts; do
not copy the Host ledger into visible XML or a second Agent-authored truth.

The L1 Agent message envelope is visible recognition metadata. Host identities,
Owner revision, target attempt, correlation, deduplication, and controller
authority stay outside it. A nested citation is also attributed text rather
than source authentication. If the Host cannot authenticate sender and current
controller binding, label the message unproven and do not use it as an
action-bearing correction or closure evidence.

Before replacement, require a host acknowledgement that the prior writer
capability is revoked, released, or isolated. Persist that evidence before a
new grant and require the revoke or fence sequence to precede the replacement
grant sequence. A crash between those transitions remains safely fenced and an
idempotent retry may continue from that state. Ordinary dispatch must consult
the same current-writer binding so a caller cannot bypass the interlock by
omitting a prior attempt id. Do not infer fencing from a new task id.

## Required Observation Evidence

Prefer structured host state. A useful observation distinguishes:

- queued
- running
- waiting on a typed predicate
- idle after a turn
- succeeded attempt
- failed attempt
- cancelled, dead, or missing process
- stale or fenced completion

Do not scrape arbitrary stdout into planning truth. Preserve raw output as
secondary incident evidence when needed.

For an audited or comparative run, keep host-observed facts distinguishable
from Agent claims. Record unavailable telemetry as unknown, not zero.

Useful host evidence includes:

- append-only event or state-version refs
- writer capability grant and revoke refs
- before/after source or artifact identity
- attempt-to-artifact attribution
- review target and read-only permission evidence
- external mutation, timeout, readback, and effect identity
- wall time, model usage, tool calls, waits, messages, retries, and restarts when
  the host exposes them

Before accepting a review verdict, join the dispatched reviewer and review
epoch to the current Owner revision, target attempt, candidate artifact, and
protected source or worktree identity. A mismatch invalidates the verdict. If
the same reviewer lane repeatedly returns scope-mismatched results, stop or
replace that lane instead of accumulating more textual reminders and waits.

## Capability Degradation

If the host lacks:

- cancellation: fence the result and avoid assigning overlapping mutation
- transport fencing: compare attempt ids during reconciliation and reject stale
  evidence locally
- event waits: use adaptive deadlines with an explicit observation budget
- structured task state: verify repository and artifact state directly
- durable storage: write one task-local scratch receipt only when recovery
  value justifies it

If the host cannot prove read-only authority, freeze the target and preserve a
before/after identity over the protected scope. If it cannot do either, label
the review or audit evidence unproven and do not use it for closure.

State the limitation. Do not claim stronger guarantees than the adapter can
enforce.

## Host Ownership

Host adapters own provider-specific mechanics such as:

- process and queue lifecycle
- tmux or terminal operation
- worktree creation and isolation
- transport retries and heartbeats
- user-channel authentication, delivery, and readback
- capability token enforcement
- host logs and trace storage

The supervisor owns the reasoned decision about whether to dispatch, observe,
retry, replace, block, recover, or report readiness. The Host carries out only
authorized operations; the Owner, Host, or caller closes according to current
lifecycle authority.

## Handoff Between Hosts

Before moving supervision:

1. freeze or terminalize the prior writer
2. record current owner revision, task, and attempt identity
3. record repository and artifact identity
4. record active side effects, leases, or external operations
5. preserve accepted evidence and unresolved findings
6. state unavailable capabilities in the receiving host
7. require the receiver to rebuild current truth before mutation

Do not map host-native ids into a shared global namespace unless the owner
already defines that mapping.
