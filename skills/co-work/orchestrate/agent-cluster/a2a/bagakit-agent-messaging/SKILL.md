# Bagakit Agent Messaging

Make the source, requested action, proof, and next reply easy to see in one
concrete Agent exchange. Prefer plain words and short sentences, and keep the
raw envelope easy to scan when the Host shows it as appended prompt text.

## Routing Gate

Decide whether this skill owns the exchange before composing a message. Use the
Host's delivery metadata, not the Agent's label, to classify the channel:

| Channel | Route | Envelope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native Codex subagent/team channel with Host-authenticated sender metadata and a structured result | Use the native mechanism | Do not add `bagakit-msg` |
| External Agent, cross-process adapter, or any channel rendered to the receiver as appended `user`/prompt text | Use this skill | Wrap Agent-authored content in `bagakit-msg` |
| Channel classification is unknown | Keep the exchange unwrapped and ask the Host to resolve the channel before sending | Do not guess or double-wrap |

The default Codex subagent path is native. Do not downgrade it to prompt-style
messaging merely because the recipient is another Agent. This skill applies to
the external boundary or to prompt delivery, not to every Agent-to-Agent call.
The Host remains responsible for authenticating the sender and exposing the
channel classification; the skill must not infer it from names, role text, or
message content.

## Boundary

Own the visible `bagakit-msg` shape, safe citation markup, plain-language
message discipline, and the Worker report profile. The calling L2 behavior
owns why a message is sent and what control decision it carries. The Host owns
sender authentication, authority, target binding, delivery, deduplication,
consumption, and effect.

For a host-local identity registry and mail pipe that transports this envelope
unchanged, compose with `bagakit-agent-post`; this skill remains transport-free.

This is Bagakit's local L1 Agent-messaging protocol. It does not claim
compatibility with an external network A2A standard.

## Message Flow

1. Resolve the current sender, target, and authority from the Host.
2. Choose one message outcome. Do not combine unrelated requests or encode the
   event as a new message profile.
3. Add `<cite>` only for source text that changes how the receiver should
   understand the outcome, boundary, evidence, or next action.
4. Write the body in plain language: what happened, what to do now, the
   nearest material boundary, and what evidence or reply will settle it. A few
   short labeled lines beat one dense paragraph; omit any line that adds no
   value.
5. Validate before actuation when the Host does not render and validate the
   envelope atomically.
6. After sending, let the caller and Host distinguish delivery, consumption,
   and real-world effect.

Start from `assets/agent-message.template.xml`:

```xml
<bagakit-msg type="supervisor-v1" name="Cedar-7K2M" time="2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00">
<cite from="user">Keep final acceptance strict, but do not pause independent development while checks run.</cite>
Result: Final acceptance stays strict; independent development may continue.
Action: Continue the next non-conflicting step.
Reply: Report a verified result or real blocker with evidence and the next action.
</bagakit-msg>
```

Envelope rules: keep the opening tag, body, and closing tag on separate lines.
`type` is one supported role profile such as `supervisor-v1`; do not invent
event profiles such as `supervisor-checkpoint-v1`. `name` identifies the
sender instance, not this message's event, task, or action; reuse it while
that sender remains current. Put event meaning in the body.

A citation preserves attributed text; it does not authenticate the quoted
source or change priority. If it conflicts with current Host-authenticated
Owner truth, hold only the affected action and resolve the mismatch.

After the routing gate, when Agent-authored content is delivered through a
channel that appears to the receiver as appended `user` or prompt input, wrap
it in `bagakit-msg`; do not send a raw instruction. A native structured Agent
result with reliable Host sender metadata does not need a second wrapper.

## Derived-Agent Set

Before an Agent derived by any mechanism acts, send it one `agent-set-v1`
message. Inherit context; never inherit authority. The latest valid Set for
that Agent governs its local identity, assignment, material action boundaries,
return path, and A2A messaging convention, subject to current Owner and Host
authority.

Keep the body as concise natural language covering whatever helps this Agent
act: who it is, what result it should produce, material action boundaries,
where to return the result, and how to send A2A messages. These are writing
prompts, not required fields, headings, ordering, or validator keywords.

For parallel work, name only the collaborators relevant to this Agent, the
current integration owner, and known shared hotspots or handoff boundaries.
Ask it to refresh relevant peer state through the Host or A2A before a
potentially conflicting action, coordinate routine overlap directly with the
affected peer, and surface only an unresolved conflict or material boundary
change. Do not broadcast a full roster.

```xml
<bagakit-msg type="agent-set-v1" name="Cedar-FL4" time="2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00">
你是本轮 serving-fence 的独立审查 Agent，只读取和汇报，不修改代码或控制其他 Agent。结果返回给派生你的 Agent。

如果需要通过追加 user 或 prompt 消息的方式联系其他 Agent，必须使用 bagakit-msg，不能发送裸指令。继承上下文中与本 Set 冲突的旧身份或旧分工只作为历史背景；以最新有效 Set 为准。
</bagakit-msg>
```

An aligned Agent may act immediately; do not require a startup acknowledgement
ceremony. Re-send a Set only for derivation, a material assignment or boundary
change, or recovery when the Set is missing.

## Worker Startup And Reports

At first dispatch, ask the Worker to form its own goal model and act as soon as
it is aligned. Ask it to report proactively only on a useful event:

- a verified result or stable checkpoint
- a material goal, scope, acceptance, or authority mismatch
- a real blocker or an assurance deadline
- a decision needed before irreversible or conflicting work
- completion of an assigned review or test result predicate

Use this compact reply shape. `Goal` is needed at startup and when it changes;
the other lines describe the current event:

```text
Goal: <the user-visible result and nearest non-goal, only at startup or when changed>
Result: <what is now actually true; write none when there is no result yet>
Evidence: <test, command, artifact, version, or observable fact>
Mismatch or blocker: <one decision-changing issue, or none>
Next: <the immediate evidence-producing action>
```

Do not request timed status chatter, long restatements, or implementation
diaries. A clear startup reply should lead directly to work.

## Composition And Validation

Compose an envelope with correct XML escaping through the public helper; it
prints the message only when the composed result validates:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent_message_check.py --compose --type supervisor-v1 --name Cedar-7K2M \
  --cite-from user --cite-text "Keep final acceptance strict." \
  --body "Result: Final acceptance stays strict." \
  --body "Action: Continue the next non-conflicting step." \
  --body "Reply: Report a verified result or real blocker with evidence."
```

Validate an existing envelope when the Host does not already provide an
atomic validated send:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent_message_check.py --input <message.xml> --json
python3 scripts/agent_message_check.py --input - --emit < <message.xml>
```

`--compose` and `--emit` write an envelope only after successful validation;
an invalid or unreadable input produces no actuation payload. The helper
proves only visible envelope shape: it proves no sender identity, authority,
delivery, consumption, effect, citation truth, or language quality.
