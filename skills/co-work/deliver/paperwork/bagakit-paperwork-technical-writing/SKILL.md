# Bagakit Paperwork Technical Writing

Deliver technical collaboration documents that are concise and source-faithful,
or readable for publication and actionable for execution.

## Layering

`bagakit-paperwork-technical-writing` is a paperwork L2 delivery skill.

Use `bagakit-writing-core` for generic writing mechanics:

- route and foundation checks
- title promise, structure, and claim/support discipline
- de-AI-tone pass through `bagakit-writing-core` and `bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone`
- prose-mechanics review
- evidence architecture, source parentage, and counterevidence
- rewrite-feedback and no-regression review primitives

For the `distill` route, compose `bagakit-writing-intake` when available for
source-material state, provenance, and privacy boundaries. Keep the route
standalone-first when Intake is absent; do not make the adapter a hard
dependency.

This skill owns the technical article delivery envelope:

- `article.md`
- `execution_appendix.md`
- `review_report.md`
- technical profile budgets and hard gates
- engineering evidence, baseline regression, and source-parentage reporting
- controlled-technical activation for execution-bearing procedures and
  appendices, without applying procedure style to article rationale

It also owns the concise technical-collaboration distillation route:

- `refined.md` when a file artifact is explicitly requested;
- source inventory, protected-facts reconciliation, and source-scope appendix;
- compact topic-grouped output for chats, meeting notes, drafts, and incident
  logs, without forcing those inputs through article-length gates.

Standalone-first rule: if `bagakit-writing-core` is unavailable, continue with
the bundled local references and checker, then record that the core composition
was not available.

Technical-writing normally reaches `bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone` through core.
The de-AI-tone technical profile may exempt precise technical terms, but it
still flags PR inflation, vague authority, fake contrast, and chatbot artifacts.

## Relationship To Refine-Doc

`refine-doc` is the concise `distill` mode of this skill, not a second runtime
skill or a separate source of truth. The relationship is:

- `distill`: compress and reconcile raw technical collaboration material into a
  source-faithful brief with a compact evidence appendix;
- `article`: develop a publishable technical article and its execution handoff;
- shared Core and de-AI-tone primitives: provide structure, evidence,
  protected-span, semantic-preservation, and prose checks to both routes.

Use the `distill` mode when the reader needs facts and actions quickly. Continue
from a stable brief into the `article` mode only when publication or a full
execution handoff is actually required. `$refine-doc` and `$bagakit-refine-doc`
are trigger aliases for the `distill` mode; they do not create another install
unit or delivery contract.

## Purpose

- Turn messy technical discussions into structured, reviewable articles.
- Keep writing quality explicit through objective checks and repeatable review steps.
- Keep output split clear: publication narrative vs execution appendix.
- Keep workflow standalone-first: core drafting and checks run locally without mandatory external systems.
- Prevent regression by carrying forward proven strengths from prior versions.
- Prevent high-compression rewrites from dropping baseline evidence classes.
- Default to full first-draft quality instead of incremental short scaffolds.
- Reuse advanced human-writing patterns as in-skill guidance overlays, without creating child skills.

## When to Use This Skill

- You need to draft, rewrite, or polish a technical blog, RFC-style article, or engineering postmortem.
- You need writing that is both externally readable and internally actionable.
- You need a traceable writing loop with clear gates and revision evidence.
- You need to distill fragmented technical collaboration material into a short
  facts-and-actions brief, including when the user says `炼化`, `精炼`,
  `提炼`, `distill`, `$refine-doc`, or `$bagakit-refine-doc`.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- You only need translation or grammar-only proofreading.
- You need marketing copy or brand storytelling not tied to engineering logic.
- You only need free-form brainstorming without publication/execution output constraints.

## Input Contract

- Required:
  - Topic and target reader.
  - One source of truth (notes, draft, transcript, or prior article).
- Strongly recommended:
  - Success criteria (for example: publish readability, handoff readiness).
  - Constraints (deadline, length range, tone, prohibited claims).
- Optional:
  - External references for evidence.
  - Prior audit feedback.

For the distillation route, mixed pasted text, local files, cloud documents, or
chat exports are valid source sets. Cloud and chat adapters remain optional host
capabilities and are read-only unless the user separately authorizes a write.

## Output Discipline

Follow `docs/specs/output-discipline.md` for writing deliverables.

- settle reader, objective, and evidence shape before drafting high-stakes work
- keep source evidence in the brief appendix, `review_report.md`, or
  `execution_appendix.md`, not as hidden confidence in the prose
- use explicit gap notes when evidence is missing
- make no-regression checks preserve baseline evidence classes, not just word
  count or style

## Output Routes and Default Mode

- Deliverable archetype/type: technical-writing transformation skill with two
  explicit routes: `distill` (`source fragments -> concise technical brief`)
  and `article` (`source notes/draft -> publishable article + execution handoff`).
- Distill route default: render Markdown in the current conversation. Write
  `refined.md` only when the user requests a file or supplies a destination.
- Distill route optional review output: `review_report.md` when the user needs
  an auditable handoff; do not manufacture article outputs for a brief.
- Article route action handoff: `execution_appendix.md` with run steps, checks, and rollback notes.
- Article route memory handoff: `review_report.md` with change summary, quality evidence, and residual risk.
- Article route default behavior (no adapter): write outputs locally in the active working directory and keep paths explicit in final response.
- Adapter policy: optional adapter routes are allowed, but this skill is standalone-first and must work with no adapter.
- First-draft default: article must already meet profile-level density checks (word floor, cases, evidence anchors).
- Article route required outputs:
  - `article.md`: publication-oriented main text.
  - `execution_appendix.md`: field-level checks, gates, and operational notes.
  - `review_report.md`: what changed, what improved, what remains.
- Article route optional outputs:
  - `outline.md`: structured outline before drafting.
  - `forum_minutes.md`: when expert-forum review is enabled.
  - `review_packet.md`: when independent review, source parentage, or
    publication readiness must be mergeable outside chat memory.

## Runtime Surface Declaration

- top-level Bagakit runtime surface roots:
  - none by default
- this skill writes explicit working-directory outputs instead of owning one
  Bagakit persistent runtime root
- stable contract:
  - `docs/specs/runtime-surface-contract.md`

## Non-Negotiable Boundary

- `article.md` is publish-only narrative.
- Internal process metadata and directives must not appear in `article.md`.
- Execution fields (`discussion_clear`, `user_review_status`, claim/tool validation, handoff path) belong to `execution_appendix.md`.
- Stage/gate tracking belongs to `review_report.md` (or response footer), not to publish copy.
- The distill route is not a publishable article: do not apply article profile
  word floors or H2-count gates to it. Apply the distillation guardrails and
  the shared Core/de-AI-tone checks that fit the final artifact.

## Archive Gate (Completion Handoff)

- Article route: verify all required outputs exist and include concrete file
  paths in handoff. Archive status can be `complete` only when hard gates pass
  and unresolved placeholders are zero. Record both handoff directions:
  `action_handoff -> execution_appendix.md`, `memory_handoff -> review_report.md`.
- Distill route: complete only when the brief's source scope, protected facts,
  gaps, and masking review pass; a file path is required only when a file was
  explicitly requested.
- If a hard gate fails, stop at review mode and deliver only diagnosis plus the
  next deterministic fix.

## Workflow

0. Choose the route before drafting.
- Use `distill` for a concise technical-collaboration brief from fragmented
  chats, meeting notes, drafts, or incident logs.
- Use `article` for a publishable technical article with execution handoff.
- Do not force a distill brief through article word floors, H2-count gates, or
  publication-only outputs.

0.5. Choose the execution-evidence branch after intent routing.
- Load `references/engineering-evidence-route.md` when the intent is a
  technical proposal, performance validation, root-cause repair, compatibility
  patch, infrastructure rollout, deployment guide, or operations runbook.
- Use it as an enhancement for the `protocol` or `infrastructure` profile;
  keep the shared Core evidence, structure, and de-AI-tone checks in force.
- Select the verification protocol by metric and document type. Do not apply
  fixed sample-size or percentile requirements to documents that cannot be
  proved by those measurements.
- Skip this branch for general explanation, research synthesis, notices,
  concise distillation, and sentence-level rewriting unless the task also has
  an execution-bearing intent.

### Distill Route

When the route is `distill`, read:

- `references/distillation-workflow.md` for source inventory, extraction,
  reconciliation, and verification;
- `references/refined-document-template.md` for the compact output shape;
- `references/distillation-guardrails.md` before handling internal or
  sensitive material.

Then:

1. Inventory source type, reader, action, time range, count, omissions, and
   provenance. For mixed sources, keep one logical or repo-relative pointer per
   source and deduplicate only after comparison.
2. Mark commands, configuration, URLs, metrics, dates, versions, IDs, owners,
   errors, quotes, and meaningful caveats as protected. Preserve exact values;
   replace credential values with `[已脱敏]` while retaining command or field
   shape.
3. Extract only five classes: `结论、判断`, `数据、指标`, `步骤、操作`,
   `工具、资源`, and `踩坑、根因`. Drop process chatter. Keep unresolved items
   when they affect a decision, action, or safety boundary and label them as
   `待确认` or `待补证据`.
4. Reorder by technical theme rather than source timeline. Surface conflicting
   facts instead of silently selecting one, and preserve source parentage for
   non-obvious claims.
5. Render a conclusion-first brief with topic sections, a symptom → root cause
   → fix table when useful, and an appendix stating source scope, time validity,
   exclusions, and limitations.
6. Recheck facts, units, sequence, causal direction, secret masking, and
   time-sensitive claims. Run `python3 scripts/mask-secrets.py` when source
   material may contain credentials, then review its candidate findings before
   external delivery.

The distill route does not perform new research, automatically write to a home
directory, create a Feishu document, or send a message. Those are separate
explicit operations owned by the relevant host skills.

### Article Route

When the route is `article`, continue with the article workflow below and its
existing `article.md`, `execution_appendix.md`, and `review_report.md` contract.

1. Define reader and objective.
- Write one sentence for target reader, one sentence for decision/action expected after reading.

2. Select article profile and content budget before drafting.
- Choose profile: `brainstorm` / `protocol` / `infrastructure` / `general`.
- Write a compact budget card in `review_report.md`: target words, case count, diagram count, full-sample requirement.
- Add readability budget: `H2 short proposition coverage`, `anchor loop (open/mid/end)`, `long sentence ratio`, `memory-hook review target`.
- For `brainstorm` profile, also budget sampling protocol metadata (`sampling object`, `sample size`, `window`, `review role`).
- First-draft rule: do not output framework-only short draft as final article.

3. Run a version baseline gate only when a prior version exists and regression
   comparison is part of the request.
- Read the previous `techniques`, gap analysis, and latest review when they
  exist.
- Record a 3-column baseline note in `review_report.md`: keep / add / tighten.
- Record baseline evidence classes when the comparison is material.

4. Build outline first.
- Keep H2 count between 3 and 5.
- Use H3 as scan anchors (problem, mechanism, signal, action).
- Keep planning contract in `outline.md`; do not copy planning scaffolding into publish article.

5. Draft with argument order.
- Section-level: lead with judgment.
- Paragraph-level: evidence/mechanism first, then local conclusion.
- End each major section with explicit action or validation signal.
- Keep publish narrative continuous; avoid checklist-like process fields in body text.
- Memory/readability rules:
  - each `##` section starts with one short restatable proposition (<=16 units).
  - split sentences longer than 40 units into `judgment sentence + evidence sentence`.
  - keep long sentence ratio under 25% for non-general profiles.
  - add one memory anchor every 350-450 words; quality is reviewed by agent gate (not hard-coded script pass/fail).
  - avoid 3+ consecutive mechanical short sequence sentences (`先X。再Y。...`) and clean fragment-like residual short lines.
  - AI-tone lexicon checks are warning-level lint only (see `references/ai-tone-terms.txt`); final rewrite judgment is human/agent review.
  - ending uses either `three-question close (goal/status/next step)` or `one-line key-claim recap`.

6. Run pre-gate self-check (recommended, non-blocking).
- Apply one writer loop from `references/human-writing-patterns.md`: context transfer, section option curation, and blind reader test.
- Compute the weighted score from `references/agent-gate-rubric.md` and record assumptions in `review_report.md`.
- This self-check is guidance for drafting quality and cannot override hard-gate failures.

7. Split publication and execution content.
- Main article explains why the approach is correct.
- Execution appendix defines how to run, verify, and recover.
- If process fields are needed for traceability, write them only in appendix/report.

7.5. Review execution-bearing prose for procedural precision.
- Read `references/procedural-precision.md` for procedures, runbooks,
  installation steps, recovery actions, or a `controlled_technical` Intake
  route.
- Record text class, terminology source, actor/action mapping, sequence, and
  accepted deviations in `execution_appendix.md` and `review_report.md`.
- Keep article narrative and design rationale outside this stricter mode.

8. Run the article-specific hard gate checks once for the current article.
   Reuse applicable Core/tone receipts from the same text; do not repeat general
   lint or full-review steps that add no distinct evidence.
- Run `python3 scripts/check-article.py --input <article.md> --strict --profile <profile> --report <review_report.md>`.
- Fix all `errors` before publishing.
- For a rewrite with a supplied prior version, pass
  `--baseline <previous_article.md>`; omit baseline comparison when no prior
  version exists or regression comparison is out of scope.
- Treat high-compression + evidence-class drop as release-blocking regression.
- For high-content baseline rewrites, compression over 45% requires explicit scope-cut note; otherwise block release.

9. Run program warning review and agent gate.
- Review warnings from checker with explicit decisions in `review_report.md`.
- Score with `references/agent-gate-rubric.md` and emit findings (`P1/P2/P3` + file/line + fix direction).
- If any `P1` remains open, status is `revise` and release is blocked.
- For high-stakes or independently reviewed articles, fill
  `references/review-packet-template.md` as `review_packet.md` and record
  source parentage, counterevidence, accepted deviations, and reviewer verdict.

10. Run optional expert-forum review for high-stakes topics.
- Use `lightning_talk_forum` to converge quickly.
- Use `deep_dive_forum` when one claim is controversial or high-risk.
- Keep references, scoring, and claim/tool validation traceable.

11. Final handoff.
- Publish `article.md`.
- Store `execution_appendix.md` and `review_report.md` for downstream implementation.

## Fallback Path (No Clear Fit)

- If source material is too weak, first request one concrete reader profile and one target decision.
- Repair actionable gate failures within the requested scope and budget. Stop
  with diagnosis only when missing evidence, authority, or a repeated failure
  prevents further useful repair; do not publish a failed article.
- If external references conflict, keep both views in `execution_appendix.md` and mark decision owner explicitly.

## Quality Gates

- Hard gates:
  - Distill route: protected facts, source count/range, source parentage,
    conflict/gap visibility, and required secret masking are preserved.
  - Distill route: no unsupported metric, command, link, date, root cause, or
    recommendation is introduced.
  - Exactly one H1.
  - H2 count in configured range (default 3~5).
  - No unresolved placeholders.
  - No internal directive leakage in publish article.
  - Profile density floor passed (`--profile`).
  - Readability floor passed for non-general profiles (`restatable proposition`, `anchor loop`, `long sentence ratio<25%`, `short break density`).
  - No high-compression rewrite regression vs baseline evidence classes.
- Warning gates:
  - Overloaded bullet sections (continuous list items > 5).
  - Generic headings with low semantic specificity.
  - No concrete example markers in body.
  - Evidence pack is thinner than baseline.
  - AI-tone lexicon hits requiring human rewrite judgment.
  - Suspicious content shrink relative to baseline draft.
  - Memory-anchor quality and ending recall closure are agent-reviewed warnings.
  - `brainstorm` sampling metadata completeness is warning-reviewed (object/size/window/review role).
  - Weighted score formula is for review/self-check guidance, not script-level pass/fail.

Distill output is judged against the distillation contract, not article density
floors. If the source boundary or a hard fact is unresolved, stop at a brief
with an explicit gap instead of promoting it to a publishable conclusion.

See details in `references/quality-gates.md`.

## Complexity Guardrails

- `preset-heavy` / `预设偏多`:
  - keep one default drafting route; put scenario variants into optional profile notes.
  - check: list defaults in one place and keep each default justified.
- `implementation-heavy` / `实现偏重`:
  - do not solve narrative quality by adding scripts first.
  - check: keep memory/readability quality primarily in rubric review before script hard gates.
- `too-many-defaults` / `默认行为太多`:
  - avoid hidden defaults outside profile budgets and hard-gate table.
  - check: if a new default is added, document trigger and tradeoff explicitly.
- `over-hard-validation` / `校验过硬`:
  - avoid over-hard validation and strict gate expansion on qualitative writing dimensions.
  - scripts should gate objective invariants; qualitative memory-hook quality stays warning + agent review.
  - check: verify memory-hook decisions are review/audit records, not fixed phrase pass/fail.
- `scattered-constraints` / `约束分散`:
  - keep single-source constraint statements in `references/quality-gates.md` and reference from other docs.
  - check: avoid duplicating must-rules without a single-source anchor.
