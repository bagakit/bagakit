# Intake Packet Contract

`bagakit-writing-intake` emits `intake_packet` as its authoritative artifact.
The packet is a handoff object, not a draft.

Intake does not produce final prose. When final prose is requested, Intake
stops at packet emission plus a handoff note; the same agent may continue with a
downstream skill only when that skill is available and the packet does not show
Core or user-input blockers.

## Evidence Rules

- Every profile claim, friction, style candidate, and risk candidate must cite
  at least one `evidence_ledger.id`.
- Every `language_profile.dimensions[]` item must separate observation from
  candidate rule. Observation records what the evidence shows; candidate rule
  records what future writing may do if scope and rollback checks pass.
- Every `language_profile.dimensions[]` item must include `name`,
  `observation`, `candidate_rule`, `scope`, `rollback_condition`,
  `evidence_ids`, and `confidence`.
- Every `rewrite_feedback_rule_candidates[]` item must include `delta_type` so
  downstream owners can distinguish content, structure, tone, rhythm, evidence,
  specificity, and layout deltas before accepting a candidate rule.
- Use `source_scope: inferred` only for gaps or route assumptions, not for
  claims about a person's style.
- Keep excerpts minimal. Prefer pointers when the source material already lives
  in the task context or a user-provided artifact.
- Do not include private raw corpora, long samples, or reusable personal
  profile data unless the user explicitly confirms that reuse boundary.

## Confidence Rules

- `high`: repeated direct evidence, or one direct user-stated preference.
- `medium`: one concrete sample plus no conflicting evidence.
- `low`: thin evidence, ambiguous signal, or plausible but unconfirmed route.

## Handoff Rules

- If `core_risk_candidates` is non-empty, the next owner is usually
  `bagakit-writing-core`.
- If the only issue is AI-tone cleanup and protected spans are clear, the next
  owner may be `bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone`.
- If Core risks are clear or resolved and taste overlay is requested, the next
  owner may be the generic `style-overlay`; name `qihan-writing` or another
  concrete style skill in `owner_reason` or `must_read_refs` when known.
- If a channel or artifact-specific delivery step is needed, the next owner may
  be the generic `delivery-skill`; name the concrete delivery skill when known.
- If the correct owner is outside the known enum, use `other` and explain the
  owner in `owner_reason`.
- If material is too thin to route, hand off to the user with one
  decision-changing question.
