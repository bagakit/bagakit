description: L1 paperwork primitive for detecting and rewriting low-human, AI-toned prose in Chinese and English. Use when a writing task needs de-AI-tone audit, AI-smell detection, structural rhythm review, lexicon checks, rewrite protocol, or publishable-prose polish without adopting a personal style profile.

# bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone

Use this skill when the task is to remove AI-toned writing patterns from
Chinese or English prose.

This is a paperwork L1 primitive. It is not a personal style profile and not a
technical-writing workflow. `bagakit-writing-core` composes this skill for
publishable prose review; L2 skills should normally reach it through core.

## Scope

Owns:

- AI-tone detection and rewrite protocol
- Chinese and English AI-smell lexicon
- protected-span preflight for commands, paths, code, URLs, dates, metrics,
  versions, API symbols, and responsibility-bearing identifiers
- structural AI tells: uniform rhythm, template phrases, fake contrast,
  parallelism without information gain, vague authority, PR inflation
- context profile exceptions for technical, docs, blog, social, and casual prose
- scene packs for chat, status, docs, public-writing, and technical prose

Does not own:

- title promise, evidence architecture, route memo, or longform review
- qihan personal taste
- technical article fact verification or execution handoff
- detector evasion or claims that a text is human-authored

## Default Workflow

1. Detect the dominant language and profile.
2. Detect or infer the scene pack.
3. Load `references/protected-spans.md` and preserve hard-information spans.
4. Load `references/rewrite-protocol.md`.
5. For detailed pattern examples, load `references/patterns.md`.
6. For word-level checks or script-backed audit, use
   `scripts/bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone-cli.sh lint`.
7. In rewrite mode, produce:
   - issues found
   - protected spans and scene assumption
   - rewritten version
   - change summary
   - second-pass audit

## Modes

- `detect`: identify AI-tone issues only; group by P0/P1/P2.
- `rewrite`: detect, rewrite, summarize changes, then run a second-pass audit.

If the original text is already strong, say so and avoid unnecessary edits.
De-AI-tone work should remove fake polish, not flatten useful voice.

## Required Quality Rule

For final prose, public-facing summaries, rewritten drafts, titles, abstracts,
and review reports, run a de-AI-tone pass unless the user explicitly asks for
raw notes or detection-only output.

Research notes, route memos, source excerpts, and private scratch artifacts may
skip this pass.

## Runtime Surface Declaration

- top-level Bagakit runtime surface roots:
  - none by default
- this skill works through installed references, scripts, and explicit task
  outputs
- stable contract:
  - `docs/specs/runtime-surface-contract.md`

## CLI

```bash
bash scripts/bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone-cli.sh lint --profile blog --scene public-writing --fail-on warn artifact.md
bash scripts/bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone-cli.sh print-rewrite-protocol
bash scripts/bagakit-writing-de-ai-tone-cli.sh print-protected-spans
```

`ADVISORY` findings should guide rewriting but should not block by themselves.
